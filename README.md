## What's Next?
Our vision is bigger than our timeline. Here's some features we would love to implement in the future:

- **Authentication & Profiles for Each User Type.** Create authentication and profile management for three user types: Job Candidate, Job Coach, and Employer. Job Coaches should be able to create or manage profiles on behalf of their candidates, storing key information such as location, needs, interests, and resumes. This data would automatically feed into the AI job recommendation system.
- **Job Coach Collaboration Tools** Enable Job Coaches to share Job Candidate profiles and notes. We aim to support every step of the employment process by providing Job Coaches with the tools needed for their candidates' success. This includes the ability to transfer candidate profiles to another coach if needed and to record notes during the employment journey. These notes can help inform future job matches.
- **Employer Resources for Accessible Employment.** As part of our mission to promote inclusive employment, we want to provide employers with resources that support the integration of employees with disabilities. These materials will help ensure employers are informed, confident, and successful in creating accessible workplaces.
